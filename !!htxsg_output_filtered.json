Apart from the sense of achievement that came with every solved challenge, we hope participants also went away with a better understanding of how the engineers and scientists at HTX leverage Science and Technology to augment the Home Team frontline in keeping Singapore safe and secure. Find out more about what went down at HTXIC via the link in bio! This year marks the inaugural HTX Investigators Challenge (HTXIC). I am heartened to see so many youths come together to pit their wits and skills against one another in the Capture-the-Flag (CTF) event, where groups of participants compete in a customised gamified challenge arena virtually. Unlike other CTF events, HTXIC is a first of its kind event filled with challenges beyond the usual cybersecurity domain. It also involves the science and engineering domains which focus on safety and security areas that are under the Home Teams purview. Science and technology innovations are essential in augmenting our Home Teams efforts to ensure operational efficiency and safety of our officers. I hope that such events will help to groom more talents and allow them to discover their fullest potential, thereby contributing to a SmartNation and a safer Singapore. Lastly, congratulations to the winning team of the first HTX Investigators Challenge T0X1C V4P0R. And to the rest of the teams, great work!",

He successfully manipulated the electronic device in the car such as the speedometer, door locks, starting the car and even deploying the airbags. He thoroughly enjoyed the hands-on experience of compromising a system as such an attack was only theoretically taught in school.It appears that Zhen Haos all-expense-paid trip has been most rewarding for him.
