But why the name \"Blue Dolphin\"? Well, SCDF's marine vessels are named after marine creatures. While smaller ones might carry names like \"Swordfish\", this bigger fellow gets the \"Dolphin\" title! Developed in collaboration with SCDF, the Blue Dolphin has remarkably improved capabilities compared with the MRV that came before it. From a customised fire monitor to a sonar for underwater search-and-rescue operations and advanced control system for propulsion, the Blue Dolphin will next undergo system commissioning and sea acceptance trials.

We wish all the best in his future endeavours, and we hope to see him back at HTX, in his words, to contribute to the nation's safety and security from an engineering and innovation paradigm!
