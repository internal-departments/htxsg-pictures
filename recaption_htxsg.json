He stated that it was like a step into the future with countless exhibitions and each of them showcasing cutting-edge technologies that are not on the market, and solutions that were previously thought impossible to create. Another highlight he mentioned was meeting some of the creators of RSA up-close at the conference!Zhen Hao was thrilled to broaden his horizons by attending the physical workshops and trying car hacking and radio frequency (RF) hacking. He successfully manipulated the electronic device in the car such as the speedometer, door locks, starting the car and even deploying the airbags. He thoroughly enjoyed the hands-on experience of compromising a system as such an attack was only theoretically taught in school.It appears that Zhen Haos all-expense-paid trip has been most rewarding for him.
