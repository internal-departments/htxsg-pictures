I had the honour of meeting Minister Shanmugam who flew in for this exposition. I also spoke with the capable team of engineers from HTX, NCS and ST Engineering, and was exponentially mind-blown by our solutions in Securing Borders, Saving Lives, Safeguarding Public Spaces, and the one closest to my heart Solving Crimes. My apartment in Paris was broken into and turned upside down on a bright and beautiful day in Spring last year. On that fateful day, everything changed for me. The trauma was twofold. First was the burglary itself, and second, the lack of a system robust enough to render the support you need when faced with threats and dangers. Burglary, like pickpocketing, are common transgressions and you just have to learn to live with the bad and the good that comes with living in a big city. Not having closure is the only closure I got. I realized how much we have taken safety and security for granted in Singapore. None of my friends have security alarm systems installed in their homes. I would also choose to believe that you wouldnt be able to get away scot-free if you commit any crimes in Singapore, no matter how petty your misdeeds are. You will be caught, in a very short time, or eventually. It is reassuring to know that so much effort goes into advancing science and technology for homeland security to keep Singapore safe.

        "caption": "You may be familiar with recreational UAVs. But the Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) technology that we leverage for our Home Teams deployment of UAVs in the near future takes it a step further.Leveraging BVLOS technology means our UAVs can be controlled and monitored remotely from within a Command Centre. This will project police presence and augment manned patrols as well as provide wider area surveillance capability.BVLOS UAVs can also be used as first responders to emergencies by providing a situational picture of incident sites, such as major fires or terrorist attacks. As the Home Team force multiplier, HTX continues to leverage technology to enhance Home Team operations to keep Singapore safe and secure.Learn more about the BVLOS technology via the link in bio HTXsg HTScienceandTech UAV Drone BVLOS"

The warm weather may increase our frontline officers risk of fatigue and even injury due to heat exhaustion. One of the areas our HTXs Human Factors & Simulation CoE explores is the use of human factor science to optimise the design of the suits, tactical gear and daily operational wear worn by officers so as to reduce that risk. Another research breakthrough was to customise a novel moisture-trapping material for practical applications to enhance the performance of frontline officers, which could remarkably lower the likelihood of heat stroke.

At Changi Airfreight Centre, the officers brought me around to view our clearance booths. Due to the pandemic, more consumers have turned to online shopping for necessities, leisure and even groceries. Air cargo checkpoints have experienced a significant increase in volume of low value e-commerce. In 2020, ICA cleared over 21 million low-value goods through the air cargo checkpoints, which is double from the 10.5 million cleared in 2019. ICA also works closely with CAAS, MOH, Singapore Customs, HSA, SATS and authorised freight forwarders on vaccine imports, clearance and transportation through the air cargo checkpoints. Given that the vaccines have to be stored in very low temperatures, ICA ensures that the clearance process does not undermine the efficacy or delay the vaccine importation. At Pasir Panjang Scanning Station, ICA officers demonstrated how anomalies are detected during cargo inspection. Thank you ICA, for keeping our borders safe and secure.

Working closely with , our CBRNE scientists at PAAF play a key role in securing Singapores borders. Aside from employing the latest technologies to detect and deter hazardous materials in cargo shipments from entering our shores, our scientists also conduct checks and tests as part of biosurveillance, to intercept and counter invisible threats such as viruses and pathogens! Learn more about CBRNE Centre of Expertise via the link in bio. Repost Visited ICA officers at Changi Airfreight Centre and Pasir Panjang Scanning Station on New Years Day. At Changi Airfreight Centre, the officers brought me around to view our clearance booths. Due to the pandemic, more consumers have turned to online shopping for necessities, leisure and even groceries. Air cargo checkpoints have experienced a significant increase in volume of low value e-commerce. In 2020, ICA cleared over 21 million low-value goods through the air cargo checkpoints, which is double from the 10.5 million cleared in 2019. ICA also works closely with CAAS, MOH, Singapore Customs, HSA, SATS and authorised freight forwarders on vaccine imports, clearance and transportation through the air cargo checkpoints. Given that the vaccines have to be stored in very low temperatures, ICA ensures that the clearance process does not undermine the efficacy or delay the vaccine importation. At Pasir Panjang Scanning Station, ICA officers demonstrated how anomalies are detected during cargo inspection. Thank you ICA, for keeping our borders safe and secure.

Another highlight he mentioned was meeting some of the creators of RSA up-close at the conference!Zhen Hao was thrilled to broaden his horizons by attending the physical workshops and trying car hacking and radio frequency (RF) hacking. He successfully manipulated the electronic device in the car such as the speedometer, door locks, starting the car and even deploying the airbags. He thoroughly enjoyed the hands-on experience of compromising a system as such an attack was only theoretically taught in school.It appears that Zhen Haos all-expense-paid trip has been most rewarding for him.
