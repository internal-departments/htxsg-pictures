Our future intern said he had an eye-opening and mind-blowing experience, gaining new perspectives on the current security challenges from the expert-led sessions and keynotes. He stated that it was like a step into the future with countless exhibitions, each showcasing cutting-edge technologies that are not on the market, and solutions that were previously thought impossible to create. Another highlight he mentioned was meeting some of the creators of RSA up close at the conference! The participant was thrilled to broaden his horizons by attending the physical workshops and trying car hacking and radio frequency (RF) hacking. He successfully manipulated the electronic devices in the car such as the speedometer, door locks, starting the car, and even deploying the airbags. He thoroughly enjoyed the hands-on experience of compromising a system, as such an attack was only theoretically taught in school. It appears that the all-expense-paid trip has been most rewarding for him. CIC 2020 is happening again on 13-14 July this year! For those interested to join, look out for more details of enrolment for participation in May 2020! Follow our Instagram for updates!"}]}]}}
